so_many_animals = Post.create(:title => "So Many Animals", :content => "I would definitely suggest doing lots of research before coming to make sure you know where you want to go and what you want to see while in Yellowstone. The park is huge! And there is a lot to see and do. We drove through in one day and saw some highlights but probably could have done more. It can be tricky driving through there, so make sure you are prepared for the winding roads and hills. We did see Old Faithful, it was cool but there were really too many people around to feel safe during covid. The views are unmatched though, highly recommend the park overall!", :rating => "4", :created_at => "2020-08-16 15:42:48 -0700")

very_good = Post.create(:title => "Very Good", :content => "We have traveled extensively in the US.
We have visited most of the National Parks. Somehow the North Cascades National Park doesn't have the PR that other parks do and is therefore not that famous. I agree with the reviewer who wrote that the park is underrated. It definitely is!!
We entered from the west (which is the right way to do it.....) and started at the Newhalem Visitor Center (reviewed by me separately). From there we drove eastward through the park and stopped at the various viewpoints and did some short hikes.
The scenery is absolutely breathtaking!! The mountains, forests, waterfalls and lakes are stunning. We didn't know where to look first. I am attaching a few photos, but believe me, photos don't do justice to this park......You need to be there. Magnificent Majestic Scenery!!! A Definite MUST!!!", :rating => "5", :created_at => "2020-08-18 20:14:11 -0700")

bad_park = Post.create(:title => "Worst Exerience Ever", :content => "I wish those taking my money would have told me that we would not see anything. It had rained for a few days before and once we were at the reef, the captain told us that often you can't see the reef because of the run off even that far offshore. The waves were 2 to 4 feet and you could not see more then 8in in front of your face. There is no way you could snorkel and see any of the reef. They dropped 13 of us in the water and said 'Swim for it' but no one could see. Total waste of money. The information that DW shared was the only good part of the trip. Moved us to shallow water and told us that we could look in the mangroves. We could have done that for free near the parking lot. Would not ever go back.", :rating => "1", :created_at => "2020-08-19 13:58:40 -0700")

so_so = Post.create(:title => "So So", :content => "Yes itâ€™s a quick journey through unless you decide to go camping or hiking but itâ€™s still worth a day or two. I managed to do all the way through to Chelan from Seattle in a day and if just stopping at overlooks then you can do that.", :rating => "3", :created_at => "2020-08-20 17:21:48 -0700")

beautiful_drive = Post.create(:title => "Beautiful drive on a hot summer morning!", :content => "My wife and I recently decided to get out of the house and take a drive. We took the 9 mile drive through Saguaro National Park East. We've enjoyed hiking here in the past, but not with 100+ degree temperatures. So with the AC running in the comfort of our vehicle, we took in the beautiful scenery of majestic saguaro cacti and mountains. Nice way to enjoy the desert on a hot, summer day!", :rating => "5", :created_at => "2020-08-14 7:19:30 -0700")

covid_insights = Post.create(:title => "Covid insights", :content => "Obviously Denali itself is amazing - no need to rate or review the park itself. Tons of wildlife around. A quick FYI though - the Transit Bus is usually marketed as a flexible hop-on - hop-off type of tour. The idea is you can get off of one bus, walk around and explore for a bit, and then hop on another later to get back out of the park where you left off. This is NOT the case right now. Basically, we were warned that if we left our tour bus at any time, that we might have to wait for 3 hours before another bus came by that had room for us...... yet somehow ours kept picking up campers along the way at other stops. I understand buses are limited bc of resources right now, but you cant make it so that people are scared into not exploring the park at all. It's a real shame that there is no flexibility at all right now. Additionally, our transit bus driver Scott was a bit of a pill. He was very rigid and inflexible about everything. He made it so that the bus was afraid to breathe or move, which seriously minimized the enjoyment of the tour...... especially since we couldnt get off of the bus and try another bus/driver like normal. Scott clearly was a wealth of knowledge, but the way he presented the information was in a very condescending way. His demeanor was sarcastic and unpleasant. His comments and answers to people were very snippy and arrogant as if the guests were below him and a bother. I've been on a lot of safaris and wildlife tours, and the guides are always amazing - I was sad to see one in my own country be so rude. I originally was considering doing one of the more expensive tours, but opted for the transit bus to have flexibility, which apparently doesnt exist right now. Just know this going into things this current tourist season.", :rating => "4", :created_at => "2020-08-11 9:51:13 -0700")

friendly_staff = Post.create(:title => "Friendly park staff", :content => "I camped here with friends while we explored the Olympic peninsula. It was a lovely experience. We did an easy day hike and were able to see amazing waterfalls and glacier fed streams. We also drove to the salmon cascades (but didn't witness the salmon as we went at the wrong time of year) but the view was still pretty! Be sure to check out the Sol Duc Falls and the beaches if you can. Seeing the large driftwood on the beaches and the large rocks on the shoreline were unlike anything I have seen on the East Coast!", :rating => "4", :created_at => "2020-08-17 4:20:39 -0700")
